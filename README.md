# 🍽️ Food Delivery Web Application

A full-stack Food Delivery Web App designed to empower small-scale restaurants with a dedicated online ordering platform. Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this project ensures a seamless experience for both customers and restaurant administrators.


## 🌐 Live Demo

> ⚠️ **Note:** The app is hosted on [Render's free tier](https://render.com/), which puts the backend servers to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.  
> As a result, the first request may take **15–60 seconds** to respond while the server wakes up. Subsequent requests will be fast.  
> Please wait a few moments after opening the app — it will start working shortly.
